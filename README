This plugin recursivelly sources the _vimrc_local.vim files present from $HOME to the directory of the current buffer every time we change buffer.

Example: current dir is ~/a/b/c. Files are sourced in this order:
~/_vimrc_local.vim, then ~/a/_vimrc_local.vim, ~/a/b/_vimrc_local.vim, and finally ~/a/b/c/_vimrc_local.vim

No messages issued if some of _vimrc_local.vim does not exist.
